    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "#### Random Forest\n",
    " - The random forest algorithm can be used in e-commerce to recommend or suggest what type of products your customer should see [1].\n",
    " - In random forest it is easy to measure the relative importance of each feature, helping decide to drop unimportant ones, avoids overfitting, and does not have many hyperparameters [2].\n",
    " - However, having a large number of trees can make the algorithm too slow and ineffective for real-time predictions [2].\n",
    " - With feature importance it can help find the features that don't contribute enough in a dataset with lots of features where the ones that contribute the most are not clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ada Boost\n",
    " - It can be applied to a university admission system of students where either they will be admitted or denied.\n",
    " - It has the flexibility to be combined with any machine learning algorithm, it is fast \n",
    " - It is susceptible to data outliers, which will force the ensemble down the rabbit hole of working hard to correct for cases that are unrealistic, and noisy data [3].\n",
    " - Gives accurate results since it depends upon many weak classifiers for the final decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    " - In my faculty it is used to destinguish smells with electronic noses.\n",
    " - They are fairly robust against overfitting, especially in high-dimensional space [4]. SVM is also strong in computations demains with clear margins of seperation [5].\n",
    " - However, it doesn't perform well in large data sets, since training time is cubic. It also doesnt perform well with data with lots of noise [5].\n",
    " - Since the amount of data is not too large for the timming to be an issue, it is a good classifier.\n",

The random forest model seems to be overfitting, with the big difference between training f-score and testing f-score.

    "In machine learning we can combine multiple learning algorithms models, called weak learners, into a stronger one, more predictive. This combinantion is called an ensemble method. Adaboost is a type ensemble. The weak learners in AdaBoost are normally decision trees with a single split, called decision stumps [1]. A decision tree is a flow-chart structure, where each node is a question, or a test of an attribute, and each branch is a possible outcome. Adaboost is a way of combining and creating these decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "First it starts by creating a first learner that maximizes accuracy, by dividing the data with a line giving a positive and negative region, and we save the model. Then we put more weight into missclassified points (punish the model more if it misses this points) and create a new learner. This is repeated a number of times we think its needed. After we have all this learners saved, we need to combine them. The individual learners can be weak, but as long as the performance of each one is slightly better than random guessing, the final model can be proven to converge to a strong learner [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance for each learner is evaluated and weighted. If a learner is random we want to have a weight of 0, if it has a low accuracy, a negative weight, and if it has a good accuracy, a positive weight. For this we use a ln function. Then to combine we add positive weights and subtract negative weights from each region of the weak learners to form the stronger learner. This stronger learner is then used to predict.\n",

    "I didn't think hours-per-week would be a better feature than occupation, since a person can have high earnings in investments without many hours of work. However, if a person works less hours than average, probably means a person in part time job or unemployed. I also guesed that education-level would have more weight than education-num, because a person that fails in school would have a high education-num without the degree that results in a higher paying job. My guess probably was wrong because even if a person doesn't finish the degree it may have learned the skills to earn a higher paying job than a person with the same degree without those extra years."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "There is a loss of accuracy of 3.1% and a loss of f-score of 6.4%. Since potentially the more people we find earning >50k the more donors our charity will have, future data sets will be large, so I think the small loss is acceptable for a higher training speed. Even tough for this small data set adaboost is fast. On the otehr hand, with a beta of 0.5 we are giving more emphasis to precision, since our charity doesn't want to waste money asking for money to the wrong people, so since the f-score is more penalised than the accuracy with only 5 feutures, it could affect the decision."
